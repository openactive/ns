# isCoached
A boolean property that indicates whether an Event will be coached. This flag allows an Event to be marked as being coached without having to specify a named individual as a coach. This addresses both privacy concerns and also scenarios where the actual coach may only be decided on the day.

This property can be used on: [`schema:Event`](https://schema.org/Event)

This property may include the values: [`schema:Boolean`](https://schema.org/Boolean)
