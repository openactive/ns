# OpenActive Vocabulary

This repository contains an HTML representation of the OpenActive Vocabulary, and allows terms in the vocabulary to resolve to valid HTML page. The terms are defined within the [Modelling Opportunity Data](https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/) and [Open Booking API](https://www.openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/) specifications.

The definitions and source for the OpenActive Vocabulary can be found in the [OpenActive Data Models](https://github.com/openactive/data-models), from which the contents of this repository are automatically generated.

The specification is being developed by the [OpenActive Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/openactive).
