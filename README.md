# OpenActive Modelling Opportunity Data Namespace

This repository holds the definitions and source for the OpenActive namespace. The terms in this namespace are defined as part of the [Modelling Opportunity Data](https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/) specification.

The specification is being developed by the [OpenActive Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/openactive).
